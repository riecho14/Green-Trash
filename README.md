> This script doesn't encourage you to cheat. Cheating is bad. But if anybody is judging your professional skills by the graph at your GitHub profile (which caries no value) they deserve to see a rich graph.

## System requirements
To be able to execute the script you need to have Python and Git installed.

## How to use
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and Git installed
2. Also make sure the Git you install is configured with GitHub
3. Create an empty Github Repository, if you want to make it private you need to set up your account [to show private contributions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-your-private-contributions-on-your-profile) and don't initialize it. This way, GitHub users will see that you contributed something, but they won't be able to see what it is.
4. Download the [GreenTrash.py](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) script and open the file in your text editor.
5. Delete GreenTrash.txt
6. You can customize the script in GreenTrash.py however you want here:
```python
# Configuration
number_of_days      = 366                                           # you can change this           
number_of_commits   = 10                                            # you can change this
repositories        = "https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash.git" # you can change this
```
7. After the script is already, you can immediately run it and crotzz ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦.

## Troubleshooting
### No changes after running the script
Are you using a private repository? If so, enable showing private contributions
[following this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-your-private-contributions-on-your-profile). Sometimes it can take a few minutes for GitHub to re-index your activity. Check if the repository has a new commit and wait a few minutes.

### Still unlucky
If you're still unlucky, please create an [issue](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/issues) in this repository and I will try to answer and solve it.

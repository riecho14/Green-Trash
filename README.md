## System requirements
To be able to execute the script you need to have Python and Git installed.

## How to use Green Trash with Github Actions
Create your own repo with click "Use this template" button (forked repo will not work).

Or just do in the manual way:

- Create your own repo
- Copy file `.github/workflows/greentrash.yml` and `trash_update` to your repo
- Change the `email` and `name` information on file [greentrash.yml, line 26 and 27](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/blob/main/.github/workflows/greentrash.yml#L27)
- Change the scheduling time on file [greentrash.yml, line 8](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/blob/main/.github/workflows/greentrash.yml#L8). You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) if you don't understand and you are not familiar with the cron schedule string `0 7,8,9,10,11 * * *`.

## How to use Green Trash with Python 
- Make sure you have Python 3 and Git installed
- Also make sure the Git you install is configured with GitHub
- Create an empty Github Repository, if you want to make it private you need to set up your account [to show private contributions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-your-private-contributions-on-your-profile) and don't initialize it. This way, GitHub users will see that you contributed something, but they won't be able to see what it is.
- Download the [greentrash.py](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) script and open the file in your text editor.
- Delete greentrash.txt
- You can customize the script in GreenTrash.py however you want here:
```python
# Configuration
number_of_days      = 366                                           # you can change this           
number_of_commits   = 10                                            # you can change this
repositories        = "https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash.git" # you can change this
```
- After the script is already, you can immediately run it and crotzz ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦.

## Troubleshooting
#### No changes after running the script
Are you using a private repository? If so, enable showing private contributions
[following this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-your-private-contributions-on-your-profile). Sometimes it can take a few minutes for GitHub to re-index your activity. Check if the repository has a new commit and wait a few minutes.

#### Still unlucky
If you're still unlucky, please create an [issue](https://github.com/riecho14/Green-Trash/issues) in this repository and I will try to answer and solve it.
